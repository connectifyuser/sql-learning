Based on the provided schema for the **Customers**, **Orders**, and **Shippings** tables, here are potential **SQL interview questions** to assess understanding of relational databases, querying, and data relationships:

---

### **Basic Questions**
1. **Describe the relationships between the three tables.**
   - Expected Answer: 
     - `Customers` is related to `Orders` via `customer_id`.
     - `Shippings` is related to `Customers` via `customer` (assuming `customer` maps to `customer_id`).

2. **Write a query to retrieve the names and ages of customers who have placed orders.**
   ```sql
   SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, c.age
   FROM Customers c
   INNER JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
   ```

3. **List all customers who have not placed any orders.**
   ```sql
   SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name
   FROM Customers c
   LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
   WHERE o.order_id IS NULL;
   ```

4. **Write a query to count the total number of orders for each customer.**
   ```sql
   SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders
   FROM Customers c
   LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
   GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name;
   ```

---

### **Intermediate Questions**
5. **Find the customers who have spent more than $1000 in total.**
   ```sql
   SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, SUM(o.amount) AS total_spent
   FROM Customers c
   INNER JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
   GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name
   HAVING SUM(o.amount) > 1000;
   ```

6. **Retrieve the second most expensive order across all customers.**
   ```sql
   SELECT item, amount
   FROM Orders
   ORDER BY amount DESC
   LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;
   ```

7. **Write a query to find customers who have shipped items with a specific status (e.g., status = 1).**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT c.first_name, c.last_name
   FROM Customers c
   INNER JOIN Shippings s ON c.customer_id = s.customer
   WHERE s.status = 1;
   ```

8. **Get the total shipping count for each customer.**
   ```sql
   SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, COUNT(s.shipping_id) AS shipping_count
   FROM Customers c
   LEFT JOIN Shippings s ON c.customer_id = s.customer
   GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name;
   ```

---

### **Advanced Questions**
9. **Find customers who have placed an order but have no associated shipping records.**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT c.first_name, c.last_name
   FROM Customers c
   INNER JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
   LEFT JOIN Shippings s ON c.customer_id = s.customer
   WHERE s.shipping_id IS NULL;
   ```

10. **Write a query to get the most common shipping status for each customer.**
    ```sql
    SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, s.status, COUNT(s.status) AS status_count
    FROM Customers c
    INNER JOIN Shippings s ON c.customer_id = s.customer
    GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, s.status
    ORDER BY c.customer_id, status_count DESC;
    ```

11. **What indexing strategies would you use for optimizing queries on these tables?**
    - Suggested Indexes:
      - Index on `Customers.customer_id` for joins with `Orders` and `Shippings`.
      - Index on `Orders.amount` for range queries or sorting by amount.
      - Index on `Shippings.status` for filtering by shipping status.

### **Scenario-Based Questions**
12. **How would you ensure referential integrity between these tables?**
    - Expected Answer: Use foreign keys.
      - `Orders.customer_id` → `Customers.customer_id`.
      - `Shippings.customer` → `Customers.customer_id`.

13. **If the `status` in the `Shippings` table represents numeric codes, how would you join another table that defines their meaning?**
    - Example Answer: Assume a `StatusCodes` table exists with `status_id` and `description` columns. Join it as:
      ```sql
      SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, sc.description AS shipping_status
      FROM Customers c
      INNER JOIN Shippings s ON c.customer_id = s.customer
      INNER JOIN StatusCodes sc ON s.status = sc.status_id;
      ```

14. **Explain how you can handle duplicate records in the `Orders` table.**
    - Suggested Solutions:
      - Use `DISTINCT` in queries.
      - Create a unique constraint on relevant columns.

15. **Design a query to retrieve customers who placed orders for items starting with the letter "A".**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT c.first_name, c.last_name
    FROM Customers c
    INNER JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
    WHERE o.item LIKE 'A%';
    ```
